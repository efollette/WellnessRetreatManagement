Next react, Node Express and Mysql Dockerized. 

More detailed readme for node and next in their folders. 

##**How to run**
1. clone
2. start docker 
3. docker-compose up --build
4. check localhost:3000 for website and localhost:5000/users to make sure database is connected

### If you do not want to use docker
**YOU SHOULD USE DOCKER**

If you really dont want to use docker than you can check the readmes in each folder for run commands. 
You will need to install npm libraries locally (check each package.json for dependencies).
Then you will need to spin up a Mysql instance locally.

**JUST USE DOCKER**
